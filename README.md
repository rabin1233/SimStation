# SimStation
SimStation exemplifies the multi-agent or agent-based architecture. It is a framework for creating simulations. A typical simulation might involve a population of agents (birds, bees, shoppers, cars, etc.) moving around an environment and interacting with random neighbors (e.g. fighting, bargaining, mating, etc.). For example, the following screenshot shows a flock of birds (the red dots). Initially the birds are flying in random directions and at random speeds. A bird interacts with another bird by copying its speed and direction. Eventually the entire flock is flying in the same direction and at the same speed. (Flocking behavior is an example of an emergent phenomenon. No single bird is directing the flock. Instead, flocking emerges from thousands of simpler interactions between pairs of birds.)
